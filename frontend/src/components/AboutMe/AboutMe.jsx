      <AboutText>
        I'm a passionate web developer with a focus on building modern, user-friendly web applications. I recently graduated from the Digital Career Institute, where I completed an intensive Web Development program. Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, primarily working with the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

      <AboutText>
        While I'm proficient in the MERN stack, I'm constantly expanding my skill set by learning new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and collaborating on creative solutions that lead to functional and engaging user experiences.
