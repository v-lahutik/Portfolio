      Hello again! Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better! ðŸ¤— Iâ€™m a passionate web developer, recently graduated from the Digital Career Institute, where I completed an intense Web Development program. Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve gotten hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, mainly working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

      <AboutText>
      I love learning new things, so even though Iâ€™m comfortable with the MERN stack, Iâ€™m always exploring new tech and frameworks to stay current. I get excited by problem-solving and tackling challenges, and thereâ€™s nothing better than teaming up to bring creative, user-friendly web apps to life!

      When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me playing board games with friends, baking, and staying active with yoga and fitness routines.
